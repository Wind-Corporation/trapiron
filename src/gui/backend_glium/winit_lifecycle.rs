/// In order to respond to user input, a [`UserApp`] object must be provided via `initializer`. This
/// object should directly or indirectly own all GUI-related resources.
///
/// A single [`Gui`](super::Gui) instance is created and later dropped by this function. It is only
/// available while this function runs, and it is only available in the thread of this function.

/// The exact order of events is as follows:
///   1. GUI initialization happens: window and OpenGL context are created.
///   2. `initializer` is executed. User logic may instantiate necessary resources, but blocking
///      operations should be deferred until the main loop to prevent UI freezes.
///   3. Main loop executes until an exit is requested. The object returned by `initializer`
///      receives events.
///   4. The object returned by `initializer` is dropped. User logic may release necessary
///      resources. Blocking operations should happen before GUI exits to prevent UI freezes.
///   5. GUI shuts down.
///   6. This function returns.
